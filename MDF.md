# MDF - Model Description Format


The purpose of the MDF is to provide a standard, JSON-based format for describing computational models of
brain and/or mental function.  The goal is to provide a common exchange format that allows models created in one
environment that supports the standard to be expressed in a form -- and in sufficient detail -- that it can be
imported into another modeling environment that supports the standard, and then executed in that environment with
identical results, and/or integrated with other models in that environment.
