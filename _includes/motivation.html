                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why is this necessary?</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                        The fields of <span>neuroscience, cognitive science</span> and <span>machine learning</span> all develop and examine models which process information, which are to varying degrees inspired by circuits in the brain. All of these use computational graphs as important elements of their models. However, these fields use different software tools to build, analyse and simulate the models making transfer of knowledge and insights difficult. There is a pressing need for a common model description format is prevalent which will allow ideas to be exchanged between researchers in these domains.
                    </h3>
                    
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Currently, there are no existing standards that fully meet the identified need. The closest standard, ONNX, is focused more on providing an intermediate representation (IR) for compilation and optimization rather than exchange. It does not naturally support hierarchical structure or general interpretable process control. NeuroML is model description format for biologically inspired neuronal networks, but is not currently used for more abstract networks and graphs used in machine learning applications.</h3>

                        <p>ModECI will provide a standardized Model Description Format (MDF) that can be used to exchange models between different software modeling environments and scientific domains and will be presented as an exchange standard, not a programming language. ONNX and NeuroML will provide guidance for the scope of MDF, and will be potential input/output formats.Such an MDF would have numerous benefits, both scientific and technological, including:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Dissemination of models and validation of model reproducibility</li>
                            <li>Migration of models across domains (e.g., use of models of brain function in machine learning applications)</li>
                            <li>Integration of models at different levels of analysis (e.g. biophysically-realistic neural models into models of cognitive function, cognitive models as agents in population level models)</li>
                            <li>Exploitation of complementary strengths of existing packages (e.g. design in a familiar environment but execute in one with better tools for parameter tuning and/or data-fitting)</li>
                            <li>More efficient development of new tools, by providing developers with a representative diversity of models, all in a common format</li>
