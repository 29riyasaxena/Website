ModECI (Model Exchange and Convergence Initiative) is a multi-investigator collaboration that aims to 
develop a standardized format for exchanging computational models among neuroscience, 
cognitive science and machine learning. 

We are aiming to define a <a href="MDF.html">Model Description Format (MDF)</a> which 
can specify a broad range of models which can be expressed as computational graphs.
