# Community contacts

Interaction with the wider computational community is essential to the development of the Model Description Format.

<h2>Community engagement workshops</h2>

We have hosted the following workshops as part of this process to engage the wider community.

<h3>Plenary Workshop</h3>

**October 27-28, 2020**

Experts in areas of cognitive science/psychology, computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, brain imaging and cognitive/symbolic modeling, systems and AI architecture, and Machine Learning participated in discussions on the feasibility of a [Model Description Format (MDF)](https://modeci.github.io/Website/MDF.html) as posited by the ModECI team. The overall consensus - there is a real need for a format like MDF and each participant saw a practical benefit of MDF furthering convergence science in their respective domains.
