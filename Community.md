# Community contacts

Interaction with the wider computational community is essential to the development of the Model Description Format

<h2>Community engagement workshops</h2>

We have hosted the following workshops as part of this process to engage the wider community.

<h3>Plenary Workshop</h3>

**October 27-28, 2020**

Experts in areas of cognitive science/psychology, computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, brain imaging and cognitive/symbolic modeling, systems and AI architecture, and Machine Learning participated in discussions on the feasibility of a [Model Description Format (MDF)](https://modeci.github.io/Website/MDF.html) as posited by the ModECI team. The overall consensus - there is a real need for a format like MDF and each participant saw a practical benefit of MDF furthering convergence science in their respective domains.

Attendees:
Dr. Jonathan Cohen,	Princeton Neuroscience Institute
Dr. Abhishek Bhattacharjee,	Yale University
Dr. Padraig Gleeson, University College of London
Dr. Ted Willke,	Intel
Dr. Tal Yarkoni,	University of Texas
Raghav Pothukuchi, Yale University
Katherine Mantel,	Princeton Neuroscience Institute
Jeremy Lee,	Princeton Neuroscience Institute
Dave Turner,	Princeton Neuroscience Institute
Jan Vesely,	Princeton Neuroscience Institute

<h3>Cognitive Science workshop</h3>

**November 19, 2020**

Domain experts gathered to deliberate the impact an MDF could have on the cognitive science process-modeling community.  Rich discussions solicited insightful feedback and cautionary tales from participantsâ€™ experiences, thus leading to a better-informed prototype for the ModECI MDF.

<h3>ML/AI Focus Group Workshop</h3>

**December 18, 2020**

The ModECI team hosted their second focused group workshop, working with the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning/Deep Learning communities to identify user-needs and areas of growth for the project. 

Experts in several areas including Python, PyTorch, and IR discussed the potential for the MDF while also providing valuable insight into future pathways.



<h2>NSF Convergence Accelerator projects</h2>

We have had discussions with the following [NSF CA projects](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/) about synergies between our projects...

<h3>Project D-xxx</h3>
