    description: "The goal of the MDF is to provide a common exchange format that allows models created in one environment that supports the standard to be expressed in a form – and in sufficient detail – that it can be imported into another modeling environment that supports the standard, and then executed in that environment with identical results, and/or integrated with other models in that environment."

    description: "ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is a well-established and actively supported standard in the machine learning community. <br/>We have leveraged this, by developing a proof of concept interface between MDF and ONNX, showing not only that MDF can complement ONNX as an exchange-oriented format among machine learning environments, but also bridge to ONNX from environments in other domains."

    description: "NeuroML is a widely accepted standard for describing biophysically-realistic models of neurons, neuronal subcomponents, and neural circuits in machine readable form, that is supported by a large number of existing programming and execution environments.<br/>We have shown that MDF can be used to encode neuroscientific models created in NeuroML, allowing such models to be run on a wider range of simulation platforms."
