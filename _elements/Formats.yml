    description: "The goal of the MDF is to provide a common exchange format that allows models created in one environment that supports the standard to be expressed in a form – and in sufficient detail – that it can be imported into another modeling environment that supports the standard, and then executed in that environment with identical results, and/or integrated with other models in that environment."

    description: "ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is a well-established and actively supported standard in the machine learning community. <br/>We have leveraged this, by developing a proof of concept interface between MDF and ONNX, showing not only that MDF can complement ONNX as an exchange-oriented format among machine learning environments, but also bridge to ONNX from environments in other domains."

    description: "PsyNeuLink is an open-source, software environment written in Python, and designed for the needs of neuroscientists, psychologists, computational psychiatrists and others interested in learning about and building models of the relationship between brain function, mental processes and behavior.<br/>We have developed mappings between a number of model types in PsyNeulink and MDF, as a proof-of-concept for use of MDF in cognitive modelling."

    title: "NeuroML",
    id: "neuromlLink",
    description: "NeuroML is a widely accepted standard for describing biophysically-realistic models of neurons, neuronal subcomponents, and neural circuits in machine readable form, that is supported by a large number of existing programming and execution environments.<br/>We have shown that MDF can be used to encode neuroscientific models created in NeuroML, allowing such models to be run on a wider range of simulation platforms."
