motivationIntro:
  - para: As the complexity of the phenomena addressed by most scientific disciplines has increased, theory is relying increasingly on the use of computational modeling.  This has produced a proliferation of software tools for modeling that, in turn, has led to a “Tower of Babel” problem, producing barriers to the exchange of theoretical and algorithmic advances across disciplines, that is making it harder to replicate and validate existing results, impeding the creation of more sophisticated models that integrate components developed by researchers across disciplines, and introducing  barriers to portability of models across software platforms and development environments.  The goal of ModECI is to overcome this balkanization of computational research and technology by developing an MDF that will permit transparent exchange of models.
  - para: Currently, there are no existing standards that fully meet the identified need. The closest standard, <span>ONNX</span>, is focused more on providing an intermediate representation (IR) for compilation and optimization rather than exchange.  <span>NeuroML</span> is a model description format for biologically inspired neuronal networks, but is not currently used for more abstract networks and graphs used cognitive neuroscience, cognitive science or in machine learning applications.
mdfIntro: ModECI will provide a standardized Model Description Format (MDF) that can be used to exchange models between different software modeling environments and scientific domains and will be presented as an exchange standard, not a programming language. ONNX and NeuroML will provide guidance for the scope of MDF, and will be potential input/output formats. Such an MDF would have numerous benefits, both scientific and technological, including
mdfPoints:
- point: Ease of dissemination of models and validation of model reproducibility
- point: Migration of models across domains (e.g., use of models of brain function in machine learning applications)
- point: Integration of models at different levels of analysis (e.g. biophysically-realistic neural models into models of cognitive function, cognitive models as agents in population level models)
- point: Exploitation of complementary strengths of existing packages (e.g. design in a familiar environment but execute in one with better tools for parameter tuning and/or data-fitting)
- point: More efficient development of new tools, by providing developers with a representative diversity of models, all in a common format
