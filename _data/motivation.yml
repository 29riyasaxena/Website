mdfIntro: ModECI will provide a standardized Model Description Format (MDF) that can be used to exchange models between different software modeling environments and scientific domains and will be presented as an exchange standard, not a programming language. ONNX and NeuroML will provide guidance for the scope of MDF, and will be potential input/output formats.Such an MDF would have numerous benefits, both scientific and technological, including
mdfPoints:
- point: Dissemination of models and validation of model reproducibility
- point: Migration of models across domains (e.g., use of models of brain function in machine learning applications)
- point: Integration of models at different levels of analysis (e.g. biophysically-realistic neural models into models of cognitive function, cognitive models as agents in population level models)
- point: Exploitation of complementary strengths of existing packages (e.g. design in a familiar environment but execute in one with better tools for parameter tuning and/or data-fitting)
- point: More efficient development of new tools, by providing developers with a representative diversity of models, all in a common format
