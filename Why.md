# Why is this necessary?

The need for a standard model description format is prevalent in 
the fields of neuroscience, cognitive science and machine learning. 
Currently, there are no existing standards that fully meet the identified need.
The closest standard, ONNX, is focused more on providing an intermediate representation (IR) for compilation and optimization rather than exchange.
Nothing exists that naturally supports hierarchical structure or 
general interpretable process control.
ModECI will provide a standardized Model Description Format (MDF) that can be used to exchange models between different software modeling environments and scientific domains
and will be presented as an exchange standard, not a programming language.
